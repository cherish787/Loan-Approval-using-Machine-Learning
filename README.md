## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The model helps financial institutions identify high-risk applications, understand key risk factors, and make standardized, data-driven loan approval decisions. By leveraging borrower data, we provide a reliable tool for risk assessment and enhance decision-making processes.
